Natural Language Understanding is the subdomain of Natural Language Processing where people red to design Al based applications have ability to understand 
the tuman languages Hindude Speech Processing team has a project named Virtual Assistant. For this project they appointed you as a data engineer (who has good 
knowledge of creating clean datasets by writing efficient code). As a dati engineer your first task is to make vowel recognition dataset. In this tank you have to
hd the prince of vowels in all possible substrings of the given strice. For each given string you have to print the total number of vowels.


import java.util.Scanner;

public class VowelRecognition {
    public static int vowelRecognition(String s) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            for (int j = i; j < s.length(); j++) {
                String sub = s.substring(i, j + 1);
                for (int k = 0; k < sub.length(); k++) {
                    if (sub.charAt(k) == 'a' || sub.charAt(k) == 'e' || sub.charAt(k) == 'i' ||
                            sub.charAt(k) == 'o' || sub.charAt(k) == 'u' || sub.charAt(k) == 'A' ||
                            sub.charAt(k) == 'E' || sub.charAt(k) == 'I' || sub.charAt(k) == 'O' ||
                            sub.charAt(k) == 'U') {
                        count++;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter a string: ");
        String s = sc.nextLine();
        System.out.println("Total number of vowels: " + vowelRecognition(s));
        sc.close();
    }
}
